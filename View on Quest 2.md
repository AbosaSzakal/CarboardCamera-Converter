# Viewing Cardboard Camera 3D 360 VR photos on Quest 2

- Use either this tool, or the original google one to convert the .vr.jpg files into a top-bottom equirectangular format
- Use SideQuest (or adb) to transfer the converted photos to Quest. I recommend putting them in the Pictures folder
- Restart Quest (this is beacuse there is a bug in Oculus TV, and the new photos won't show up until the device is restarted)
- Open Oculus TV
- Navigate to the "My Media" tab on the bottom
- Click on the photo you want to view
- On the bottom right, click on the litte 2D icon, and select "360 3D"
- When you click anywhere other than the menu UI, it toggles between 3D and 2D mode
- To exit, face the direction the menu was, and click, then click the back button on the menu

There are other media players on the Oculus Store, but none of the free ones I tried worked with these photos. 
The bigger paid media players might have this functionality, but I have not tried them yet.
